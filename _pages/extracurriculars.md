Outside of academics, I am a huge lover of table top games. I've run several [D&D 5e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) campagins and played in even more. I'm an avid enjoyer of strategy games, and a few of my favorites include *[Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan)*, Disney's *Villainous*, and *[Secret Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Hitler)*. When the weather is nice, you can often find me swinging in a hammock; when the weather is not so nice, I might be found tent or cabin camping. I try to attend as many Butler basketball games as possible, so you might see me in the student section during games.
