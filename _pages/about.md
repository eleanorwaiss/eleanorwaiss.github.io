Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Eleanor Waiss, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am an undergraduate student studying mathematics, actuarial science, and computer science at Butler University. On this website, you'll be able to learn more about me, see any previous talks I've given or papers I've written, as well as various code files I've used in those projects. 

Stay a moment, look around, and let me know if you have any questions!

Since I study fractals, I would be remiss if I didn't include some of the best I've run across. Below is what **should** be the filled Julia set for g_{13} for p(z)=z^2-0.123+0.745i and q(z)=z^2+0.12-0.3i. Unfortunately, I had implimented the profile to generate this image incorrectly, so there are a few errors throughout. Nonetheless, this image is pretty, so I'm including it anyway. Read about this notation and more fractals like it in my [JMM 2024 talk](/talks/jmm2024).
