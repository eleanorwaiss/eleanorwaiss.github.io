Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Eleanor Waiss, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am an undergraduate student studying mathematics, actuarial science, and computer science at Butler University. On this website, you'll be able to learn more about me, see any previous talks I've given or papers I've written, as well as various code files I've used in those projects. 

Stay a moment, look around, and let me know if you have any questions!
