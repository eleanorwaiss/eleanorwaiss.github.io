I submitted the following essay to Butler's annual LAS essay contest. This year's prompt was *New Ways to See the World: The Value of a Liberal Arts Education*.

## Mochas and Muffins: What Mathematicians Gain Through the Liberal Arts
Over the past several months, in sporadic moments, I’ll think about the nature of the arts in the modern world. Getting a degree in mathematics, the so-called “queen of sciences”, the arts have no bearing on the world I build on the principles of rigour and absolute truth. I’ll question why I came to Butler, or any liberal arts institution for that matter, instead of some public state school where a majority of my advanced high school credits would transfer, and I could spend more time in classes more directly related to my work as a mathematician. Walking the halls of Jordan, I see many strangers. We’re all studying vastly different things; I wonder why do we have a joint college of liberal arts and science? If I’m going onto grad school for math, why would I need a course on the arts in ancient Greece, or another on the architecture of Indianapolis, instead of spending time studying topology or differential equations? My computer science and lab science peers similarly bemoan the Core, especially around advising and registration. Why couldn’t Butler be like any other major institution and have a college devoted to the sciences?

I think back to just last month, where I was asked to present my current research project at a Butler Bound admissions event. I joined fellow researchers in welcoming prospective students and talking about our experiences as students on campus. During this time, I got to know some of my peers in Levinson Hall pretty well. I was flanked on both sides by biology students, and a psychology student wasn’t far away. We got talking, and I quickly realized that my new friends had no idea what mathematics, or mathematics research, was all about, or even how math research was conducted. I had taken four years of lab sciences in high school and knew to a certain degree how physical research projects worked. And yet, mathematics is a different beast. Even though all of these students had taken multiple semesters of calculus and statistics at Butler, math research was a foreign idea to them. And I don’t blame them; there is no experiment with a test tube or interview with a client that can get me to an exact mathematical truth. 

To be frank, the answer I game them at the time was a cop-out. “Oh, I meet with my adviser for an hour a week, outside of meetings I’ll code a program to test this, or I’ll sit at a chalkboard and derive that, or I’ll annotate a textbook.” Yes, that is all factually correct and indeed what *I do*, but that’s not *how I research*. I toy with an idea. I’ll walk to from Jordan to Butler Brew and order a mocha and muffin, and in doing so ponder how to develop one equality into another. I’ll work on a programming assignment for one class, and immediately get a spark for an idea for implementing an algorithm for testing some different hypothesis. I’ll go a week, a month, or longer without understanding one definition only for it to come to me as I’m getting dinner with a friend. Paul Lockhart, originally a research mathematician who later taught mathematics in Brooklyn, said it perfectly: 
> “To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t understand what your creation is up to.”

Mathematics, especially proof-based mathematics where a numerical answer is hardly ever the supreme goal, is a very personal and lonely endeavor. Often times, the concepts I understand the best are the ones that I struggled and toyed with in my brain the most. Partial progress towards a goal is a steppingstone to higher success, as opposed to outright failure or success. Realizing that there is no one singular correct answer but rather a multitude of proofs that all, reasonably or not, satisfactorily show as valid what we claim was a great challenge in my first and second years at Butler. And it is here that a liberal arts education shines. These skills and values were developed and sharpened in my Core classes. As much as mathematicians love precision and rigour, our ability to create new math is limited to only our ability to express and communicate meaning. The soft skills provide the backbone for any mathematician to succeed, something that simply isn’t taught in a standalone proof-based math course.

As I wander the halls of Jordan between classes, I try to remind myself: the people that came before me and will come after me, the people that wander these very same halls, we have much in common. We wear the same uniform; we sing the same war song. It’s the Core that binds us each one to another. It doesn’t matter how we got here or where we’re headed. Perhaps we’re not strangers after all.
