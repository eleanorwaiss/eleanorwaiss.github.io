I, along with two other trans\* students at Butler, were invited to present to the faculty regarding implimenting intentionally-inclusive pracites for gender queer students in and beyond the classroom. This work was done jointly with Delaney Beh, [Dr. Lavender McKittrick-Sweitzer](https://www.lmsweitzer.com/), and Dr. Elise Edwards. Since then, I have recieved much anecdotal evidence of the positive changes implimented throughout the undergraduate classroom from students, faculty, and university administration.
